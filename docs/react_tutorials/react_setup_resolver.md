Veramo core runs natively in the browser. The plugins you use also need to be browser compatible. This guide will set up
a DID resolver to work in an application created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) but
uses [CRACO](https://craco.js.org/)
to allow use of babel config required for ESM.
It is possible to add your own identity, key management, and storage plugins that are browser compatible.

### Initialize app

Initialize a new **CRA** project

```bash
npx create-react-app veramo-react-app --template typescript
cd veramo-react-app
```

Install and use CRACO

```
yarn add @craco/craco
```

Update `scripts` within `package.json`

```
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build",
  "test": "craco test",
```

Create file `craco.config.js`

```
module.exports = {
  babel: {
    plugins: ['@babel/plugin-syntax-import-assertions']
  }
}
```

Install required Babel plugin

```bash
yarn add @babel/plugin-syntax-import-assertions
```

Install veramo core, DIDResolverPlugin and some specific DID resolver implementations:

```bash
yarn add @veramo/core @veramo/did-resolver ethr-did-resolver web-did-resolver
```

Create a setup file in `src/veramo/setup.ts` and add the following code, replacing the `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` with your
own.

```ts
import { createAgent, IResolver } from '@veramo/core'

import { DIDResolverPlugin } from '@veramo/did-resolver'
import { getResolver as ethrDidResolver } from 'ethr-did-resolver'
import { getResolver as webDidResolver } from 'web-did-resolver'

// You will need to get a project ID from infura https://www.infura.io
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = '<your PROJECT_ID here>'

export const agent = createAgent<IResolver>({
  plugins: [
    new DIDResolverPlugin({
      ...ethrDidResolver({ infuraProjectId: INFURA_PROJECT_ID }),
      ...webDidResolver(),
    }),
  ],
})
```

Open `src/App.css` and add the following styles to the top of the file:

```css
pre {
    font-family: monospace;
    white-space: pre;
}

#result {
    text-align: left;
    width: 900px;
    background-color: #24232d;
    color: #25c2a0;
    padding: 15px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

Open `src/App.tsx` and replace with the following code:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'

import { agent } from './veramo/setup'

function App() {
  const [didDoc, setDidDoc] = useState<any>()

  const resolve = async () => {
    const doc = await agent.resolveDid({
      didUrl: 'did:ethr:sepolia:0x6acf3bb1ef0ee84559de2bc2bd9d91532062a730',
    })

    setDidDoc(doc)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    resolve()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <pre id="result">{didDoc && JSON.stringify(didDoc, null, 2)}</pre>
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

And that's it! When you `yarn start` you should see a DID document being resolved instead of the default landing page.

## Troubleshooting

### Outdated templates

If after running `create-react-app`, you see the following message:

```
A template was not provided. This is likely because you're using an outdated version of create-react-app.
Please note that global installs of create-react-app are no longer supported.
You can fix this by running npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app before using create-react-app again.
```

Errors

Be sure to follow the instructions in that message, and then run the `npx` command again. If you still the
message, [this answer may help](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59188624/template-not-provided-using-create-react-app).

### Dependency issues

Some of the Veramo packages that have to do with Verifiable Credentials (like `@veramo/credential-ld`) depend on a set
of libraries from the `jsonld` ecosystem which weren't designed with the same multi-platform targets in mind. Forks of
these dependencies exist, that work in all environments where Veramo should work, but you have to aid your package
manager in finding them.

The solution is to add a `resolutions` block to your `package.json` file and replacing the problematic dependencies:

```json5
// filename: package.json
{
  // ...
  "resolutions": {
    "jsonld": "npm:@digitalcredentials/jsonld@^6.0.0"
  }
}
```
