Agent explorer makes it easy to browse and interact with multiple agents while developing apps on Veramo. At it's most
basic it is a dashboard but could also be considered a front-end for a credential wallet.

## Motivation

Throughout the development cycle of Veramo from its early alpha days as DAF, we have always had some form of user
interface to help build and test features. The first UI was a React Native mobile application called daf-mobile which
has since been deprecated.

Out of necessity for a fully working UI that makes working with agents easier and helps validate Veramo APIs among many
other use-cases we created a simple dashboard called Agent Explorer.

As the Agent Explorer is a developer dashboard, the design was to be kept minimal and unobtrusive while surfacing the
very pieces of technical information that would normally be hidden for non-developers. We also wanted this UI to be
modular and flexible as Veramo is. We have implemented a widget based approach that allows developers to create their
own dashboard widgets while developing features for Veramo perhaps in another codebase. And finally the explorer
provides a quick and simple way to see whatâ€™s going on in your agents and can assist in interacting and quickly
generating bulk data for research and experiments.

## Install

After you have deployed an agent using
our [1 button Heroku deploy](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo-agent-deploy) for example. In your heroku settings
you will find the API key for your agent. Using this API key you can connect this agent and others to an instance of the
explorer.
